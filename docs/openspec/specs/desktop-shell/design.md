# SPEC-0010 Design: Desktop shell

## Context

The performance epic changed the calculus.
[SPEC-0008](../web-performance/spec.md) took the web UI from 1.8–2.9 s renders
to < 300 ms TTFB and **19 ms boosted navigations** on the reference archive —
the app now feels native, so wrapping it in a native window stops being
lipstick and starts being honest. The owner asked for a real desktop app (and
about Proton Native specifically;
[ADR-0017](../../../adr/0017-desktop-shell-wails.md) addresses it by name and
rejects it as unmaintained and wrong-stack). Today the closest thing is
`serve --open`, which launches a browser tab and leaves a terminal running.

The shell also gives the Connect story a home:
[SPEC-0011 (device sync)](../device-sync/spec.md) needs a place to show a
pairing QR and MCP connection details, and that place should exist in browser
mode too — it's a web page, not a desktop feature.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals**

- A native desktop app (macOS first; Linux/Windows via the same code) hosting
  the existing UI unchanged.
- Core stays `CGO_ENABLED=0`
  ([ADR-0013](../../../adr/0013-pure-go-sqlite-driver.md)); cgo is quarantined
  in `cmd/msgbrowse-desktop`.
- A `/settings` Connect page served by the normal web app, with server-rendered
  QR (payload per SPEC-0011).
- CI-built per-OS artifacts.

**Non-Goals**

- Mobile apps (SPEC-0011 pairs desktop/server nodes; no mobile shell).
- Auto-update.
- Code signing / macOS notarization in v1 (deferred per ADR-0017).
- Wails JS bindings / a second frontend — the UI remains server-rendered
  HTMX over HTTP.

## Decisions

### Wails v2 as the shell

- **Choice:** Wails v2 wrapping the system webview around the embedded
  server, per ADR-0017.
- **Rationale:** Go-native, system webview (small artifacts), and batteries —
  menus, dock, tray, packaging — that we'd otherwise hand-roll.
- **Alternatives:** Electron (Chromium+Node bundle — rejected), Tauri (Rust
  toolchain + Go sidecar supervision — rejected), webview/webview_go (kept as
  the documented minimal fallback; identical architecture, fewer batteries),
  Proton Native (unmaintained, React→libui, wrong stack — rejected),
  `serve --open` status quo (rejected as the end state). Full analysis in
  ADR-0017.

### Loopback HTTP on an ephemeral port, not the Wails asset handler

- **Choice:** the desktop process starts `internal/web`'s real `net/http`
  server on `127.0.0.1:0`, reads the bound port off the listener, and points
  the webview at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`.
- **Rationale:** zero divergence from the served app. The webview traverses
  the same listener, middleware, gzip, ETags, security headers, and HTMX
  behavior a browser does — every SPEC-0008 test and every future handler
  works in both modes without a second code path. An ephemeral port also
  can't collide with a concurrently running `msgbrowse serve` on 8787.
- **Alternatives:** Wails' AssetServer can dispatch requests to an
  `http.Handler` in-process with no TCP listener at all — attractive (no port,
  no socket), but it bypasses the real server path: middleware wiring,
  `Accept-Encoding` negotiation, and absolute-URL generation (the Connect
  page must display real URLs a *separate* MCP client can reach) would all
  diverge from browser mode. Rejected for v1; revisit only if the loopback
  listener itself becomes a problem.

### Server-side QR rendering

- **Choice:** render the pairing QR on the server as a PNG `data:` URI
  embedded in the `/settings` template, using a pure-Go QR library
  (`skip2/go-qrcode` is the expected pick — a new dependency, noted and
  accepted; it must not drag in cgo).
- **Rationale:** the strict CSP (ADR-0010: `default-src 'none'`,
  `img-src 'self' data:`) already permits data-URI images and forbids inline
  script; a client-side QR library would add vendored JS for something the
  server can do in one function call, and server-side rendering works
  identically in browser mode. The QR payload is opaque to this spec —
  SPEC-0011 defines it; `/settings` just encodes the bytes it's handed.
- **Alternatives:** client-side JS QR generation (more moving parts, worse
  CSP story — rejected); a separate `/settings/qr.png` route (works, but a
  data URI keeps the page self-contained and adds no route — not needed
  unless payload size ever makes inline data URIs unwieldy).

### Build isolation: tags + CI matrix

- **Choice:** all Wails/cgo code sits in `cmd/msgbrowse-desktop` behind build
  tags; desktop binaries are built only in a GitHub Actions matrix (macOS →
  `.app`/dmg, Ubuntu + WebKit2GTK → Linux, Windows → `.exe`).
- **Rationale:** webview shells cannot cross-compile, and ADR-0013's
  `CGO_ENABLED=0` core is sacred — the tag gate makes
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` keep passing everywhere the desktop target
  isn't explicitly requested, and keeps `make check` fast and pure.
- **Alternatives:** a separate Go module for the shell (heavier: version
  skew, replace directives) — rejected while tags suffice; building desktop
  artifacts locally only (no reproducible releases) — rejected.

## Architecture

```

One store, one web package, two front doors. The desktop process is the Wails
runtime plus the same server `serve` runs; the webview is just a browser we
control the lifecycle of. `/settings` is ordinary `internal/web` surface area
— template, handler, QR helper — with nothing desktop-conditional in it.

Shutdown path: window close (or menu quit) triggers the Wails lifecycle hook,
which cancels the server context → `http.Server.Shutdown` drains in-flight
requests → store closes → process exits. The same context wiring `serve` uses
for SIGINT applies, so there is one shutdown code path, not two.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Webview version drift across OSes.** WKWebView (macOS), WebView2
  (Chromium, Windows), and WebKit2GTK (Linux) advance on different cadences;
  features the UI leans on (e.g. SPEC-0008's `content-visibility`
  containment) may lag on one engine. Mitigation: the UI already targets
  evergreen browsers and degrades gracefully; the desktop matrix becomes the
  test matrix.
- **cgo CI complexity.** Three OS runners, platform toolchains (Xcode CLT,
  webkit2gtk dev packages, WebView2 SDK), slower release builds, and cache
  management — all new surface compared to the single `CGO_ENABLED=0` build.
  Mitigation: matrix jobs are release-scoped and never gate the core check.
- **WebKit2GTK availability on Linux.** Distros are split across webkit2gtk
  4.0/4.1 sonames and Wails v2 pins against a specific one; some minimal
  installs ship neither. Mitigation: document the package prerequisite;
  browser mode remains the universal fallback on Linux.
- **Ephemeral URLs.** The desktop app's origin changes every launch, so a URL
  copied out of the desktop window dies on relaunch. Acceptable: sharing URLs
  is a browser-mode workflow; the Connect page displays the durable endpoints.
- **Two instances.** Nothing prevents launching the desktop app twice (two
  servers, two ephemeral ports, one SQLite file); SQLite locking arbitrates.
  Single-instance enforcement is deliberately not in v1.

## Migration Plan

No schema, config, or data migrations — the store, config keys, and archives
are untouched, and browser mode behaves identically before and after.

1. **`/settings` lands first, desktop-free:** template + handler + QR helper
   in `internal/web`, the pure-Go QR dependency, and tests (CSP header
   assertions, data-URI rendering, copy-block content). Ships and is useful
   in browser mode immediately; blocks only on SPEC-0011 for the real QR
   payload (a placeholder/absent-state renders until pairing config exists).
2. **`cmd/msgbrowse-desktop`:** tag-gated Wails v2 shell — embedded server on
   `127.0.0.1:0`, window pointed at it, menu/quit/dock wiring, graceful
   shutdown through the shared context path.
3. **Build plumbing:** Makefile targets for the desktop build (names TBD —
   see Open Questions) and GitHub Actions matrix jobs (macOS/Ubuntu/Windows)
   producing release artifacts; core `check` job untouched.
4. **Docs:** install instructions per OS, the WebKit2GTK prerequisite on
   Linux, and the unsigned-artifact caveat on macOS (right-click-Open) until
   signing lands.

Rollback at any step is deletion: nothing in the core depends on the shell.

## Open Questions

- **Flag and target names.** The desktop command's flags (config path
  override? headless escape hatch?), the Makefile target names, and whether
  the shell reuses `--open`-style conventions are TBD — deliberately not
  invented here.
- **macOS signing/notarization timeline.** Deferred per ADR-0017; needs an
  Apple Developer ID and CI notary step. When does unsigned stop being
  acceptable — first external user?
- **Wails v3.** Currently pre-stable; it reworks the application/window API.
  Adopt on stable release or skip v2 hardening work that v3 would discard?
- **Tray + open-at-login.** Spec'd as MAY; decide whether either makes v1 or
  waits for demand.
- **Settings page scope creep.** `/settings` starts as Connect (MCP + QR);
  whether runtime-editable settings (theme, roots) ever live there is a
  separate future spec.
