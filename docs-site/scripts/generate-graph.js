# Architecture Graph

The artifact graph captures explicit relationships between ADRs and specs declared in YAML frontmatter (per the SDD plugin's ADR-0023 / SPEC-0018 frontmatter-graph conventions). Edges describe \`supersedes\`, \`extends\`, \`enables\`, \`governs\`, \`implements\`, \`requires\`, and \`related\` relationships between artifacts. The page below reflects the authored edges only; derived inverses (\`governed-by\`, \`implemented-by\`, etc.) are computed at query time by the \`/sdd:graph\` skill.

## Stats

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| ADRs | ${adrCount} |
| Specs | ${specCount} |
| Authored edges | ${authoredEdges.length} |
| Derived edges (computed) | ${derivedEdges.length} |
| Orphan ADRs (no implementing spec) | ${orphanAdrs.length} |
| Orphan specs (no governing ADR) | ${orphanSpecs.length} |

## Orphan ADRs

ADRs that no spec declares \`implements:\` against. Add an \`implements: [ADR-XXXX]\` line to a spec's frontmatter (or run \`/sdd:graph backfill\`) to remove an ADR from this list.

${orphanAdrSection}

## Orphan specs

Specs that no ADR declares \`governs:\` against. (For specs whose source-code coverage is the relevant orphan signal, use \`/sdd:graph orphans\` directly — that walks source files for governing comments and is not reflected in this static page.)

${orphanSpecSection}

## Querying the graph

The static view above is generated at docs-build time. For interactive queries:

\`\`\`
/sdd:graph validate                  # full diagnostics
/sdd:graph impact ADR-XXXX           # what depends on this ADR
/sdd:graph ancestors SPEC-XXXX       # what this spec depends on
/sdd:graph chain SPEC-XXXX           # bidirectional view
/sdd:graph orphans                   # source files, specs, ADRs
/sdd:graph backfill                  # propose edges from prose
\`\`\`

JSON output (\`--json\`) is the stable contract for any future MCP, IDE plugin, or dashboard.
